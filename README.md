Two-point model predicting likelihood of rapid august polar sea ice melt-out

This model is an experiment in predicting whether the eventual september arctic sea ice low will be in record-breaking territory, based soley on observed conditions on 5/31 + 7/31 each year:

ice condition at :

  -end-of-may melt pond fraction     
  -end of-july area/extent (that is, concentration)
